All kinds of contributions are welcome - code, tests, documentation,
bug reports, ideas, etc.

Contributing with Code
======================

Forking through Github
----------------------

First of all, you need to fork the the official repository, which is
https://github.com/pypa/pip.

Log in to Github, go to the `pip repository page
<https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_, follow the **fork** link, wait for Github
to copy the repository and then clone your fork, like::

    $ git clone https://github.com/YOU_USER_NAME/pip
    
Now you can change whatever you want, commit, push to your fork and when your
contribution is done, follow the **pull request** link and send us a request
explaining what you did and why.


All tests should pass
---------------------

Almost all changes to pip should be accompanied by automated tests -
especially ones adding new behavior.
`Nose`_ is used to find and run all tests. Take a look at :doc:`running-tests`
to see what you need and how you should run the tests.

Before sending us a pull request, please, be sure all tests pass.


Using a Continuous Integration server
-------------------------------------

We have a continuous integration server running all pip related tests at 
http://ci.cloudsilverlining.org/view/pip. But if you want to have your own,
you can learn how to set up a Hudson CI server like that in the
:doc:`ci-server-step-by-step` page.



Contributing with Tests
=======================

Pip's test coverage is not as good as we would like, so contributions of
additional tests are welcome. You can contribute these the same way you would
contribute any other kind of code: see the :ref:`contributing-with-code`
section.


Contributing with Bug Reports
=============================

Pip project is hosted at `Github`_ and uses its issue tracker system.

If you have found a bug and want to report it, go to `pip issue tracker page`_,
click **Create new**, add a descriptive
title (so we can easily identify what the bug is) and fill the description box
explaining how you got the bug, what pip version you were using and what is
your operating system, so we can reproduce the bug to try fixing it.



Contributing with Ideas
=======================

We are always open to new ideas, and we will enjoy yours. You can send
enhancement ideas and proposals via `pip issue tracker page`_,
`virtualenv mailing list`_, or #pip channel at freenode.
